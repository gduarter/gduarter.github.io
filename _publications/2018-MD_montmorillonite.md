__Abstract:__ 

In this study, we performed computational simulations to extend the behavior knowledge over molecular systems 
composed by amylose oligomers, three fatty acids often found in Brazilian vegetable oils, water solvent, and 
montmorillonite. The focus is directed to the molecular movement and to intra and intermolecular interactions, 
each simulation step being compared with the literatureâ€™s experimental profile. The calculations were mostly 
performed by Molecular Mechanics and Dynamics methods. The excellent agreement and complementarities with the 
literature results indicate, once again, the important contribution offered by the computational simulations to 
the design of new polymer-clay nanocomposites with biopolymers.
