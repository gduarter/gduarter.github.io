__Abstract__:
This study critically reevaluates reported Biginelli-like reactions using a Kamlet–Abboud–Taft-based
solvent effect model. Surprisingly, structural misassignments were discovered in certain multicomponent
reactions, leading to the identification of pseudo three-component derivatives instead of the expected
MCR adducts. Attempts to replicate literature conditions failed, prompting reconsideration of the
described MCRs and proposed mechanisms. Electrospray ionization (tandem) mass spectrometry, NMR,
melting points, elemental analyses and single-crystal X-ray analysis exposed inaccuracies in reported
MCRs and allowed for the proposition of a complete catalytic cycle. Biological investigations using both
pure and “contaminated” derivatives revealed distinctive features in assessed bioassays. A new cellular
action mechanism was unveiled for a one obtained pseudo three-component adduct, suggesting similarity
with the known dihydropyrimidinone Monastrol as Eg5 inhibitors, disrupting mitosis by forming
monoastral mitotic spindles. Docking studies and RMSD analyses supported this hypothesis. The findings
described herein underscore the necessity for a critical reexamination and potential corrections of structural
assignments in several reports. This work emphasizes the significance of rigorous characterization
and critical evaluation in synthetic chemistry, urging a careful reassessment of reported synthesis and biological
activities associated with these compounds.
