__Abstract__:
__Background:__ Solubility is a physical property of high importance to
the pharmaceutical industry, the prediction of which for potential
drugs has so far been a hard task. We attempted to predict the
solubility of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) by estimating the absolute
chemical potentials of its most stable polymorph and of solutions with
different concentrations of the drug molecule.
__Methods:__ Chemical potentials were estimated from all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations.
We used the Einstein molecule method (EMM) to predict the absolute
chemical potential of the solid and solvation free energy calculations
to predict the excess chemical potentials of the liquid-phase systems.
__Results:__ Reliable estimations of the chemical potentials for the solid
and for a single ASA molecule using the EMM required an extremely
large number of intermediate states for the free energy calculations,
meaning that the calculations were extremely demanding
computationally. Despite the computational cost, however, the
computed value did not agree well with the experimental value,
potentially due to limitations with the underlying energy
model. Perhaps better values could be obtained with a better energy
model; however, it seems likely computational cost may remain a
limiting factor for use of this particular approach to solubility
estimation.
__Conclusions:__ Solubility prediction of drug-like solids remains
computationally challenging, and it appears that both the underlying
energy model and the computational approach applied may need
improvement before the approach is suitable for routine use.
