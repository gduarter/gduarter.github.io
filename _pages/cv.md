Education
======
* Ph.D in Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, 2018

    * Thesis Topics: hydration and solvation free energies of small organic molecules of pharmacological interest; prediction of solubility of molecular solids from absolute free energy calculations; reproducibility of relative hydration calculations across different software; use of infinite dilution activity coefficients as alternative parameters for force field and method development. 

    * Adviser: David L. Mobley

* M.S. in Chemistry, Universidade de Brasília, 2013

    * Dissertation Topic: use of conceptual DFT and molecular fingerprints obtained from ab initio calculations to predict reaction paths to understand the reactivity of ambidented nucleofiles. 

    * Advisers: Fernando C. Rangel and Kleber C. Mundim

* B.S. in Chemistry, Universidade de Brasília, 2011


Work experience
======
* 2019-2021: Postdoctoral Fellow

  * Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, SUNY Stony Brook.

  * Duties included: The Rizzo Lab works with protein-ligand docking and with the development of the DOCK6 software. Design of drugs targeting the 6-HB subdomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Implementation of descriptor-driven de novo design methodology using an RDKit interface with DOCK6. Directly mentored two graduate students, Steven Pak and Christopher Corbo (2020-2021). Assisted in mentoring two senior graduate students, Lauren Prentis and John Bickel (2019-2021). Taught AMS 535 and AMS 536.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Robert C. Rizzo

* 2013-2015: Research Assistant

  * Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine.

  * Duties included:
Worked with free energy calculations in systems of pharmacological interest – solvation free energies of small organic molecules and solubility prediction from absolute chemical potentials of molecular solids and their solution phases. Innovated by using infinite dilution activity coefficients as alternatives to hydration free energies as method validation tools. Curated and updated FreeSolv, the hydration free energy database, with the addition of hydration enthalpies and entropies. Mentored two undergraduate students, Daisy Y. Kyu (2015-2016), Nam Thi (2016). Taught CHEM H2LA, H2LB, 138, 1LC and PHARMSCI 170B.
  * Supervisor: Professor David L. Mobley

* 2013: Independent Scientific Consultant
  * Consulted for the work published by F. A. R. Silva and E. R. Maia on polymer-clay nanocomposites.
