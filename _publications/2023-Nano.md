excerpt: 'we describe a fundamental model proposal for the future development of
lipid–peptoid-based customized drug delivery systems. This proposal was built based on
the synthesis of a wide variety of peptoids with structural diversity via the Ugi reaction, followed
by nanoformulations through the emulsification–evaporation process and molecular
dynamics simulations.'

__Abstract__:
Nanotechnology has assumed a significant role over the last decade in the development of
various technologies applied to health sciences. This becomes even more evident with its application
in controlled drug delivery systems. In this context, peptoids are a promising class of compounds for
application as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems. These compounds can be obtained efficiently
and with highly functionalized structural diversity via the Ugi 4-component reaction (U-4CR). Herein,
we report the design of the process control strategy for the future development of lipid–peptoidbased
customized drug delivery system assemblies. Over 20 lipid–peptoid nanocomposites were
synthesized via the U-4CR in good to excellent yields. These products were successfully submitted to
the nanoparticle formation by the emulsification–evaporation process from lipophilic solution and
analyzed via Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Several molecules generated nanoparticles with a size
 200 nm, making them good candidates for drug delivery systems, such as in cancer treatment.
