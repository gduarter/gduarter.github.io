__Abstract:__ 

Solvation free energies can now be calculated precisely from
molecular simulations, providing a valuable test of the energy functions underlying
these simulations. Here we briefly review “alchemical” approaches for calculating
the solvation free energies of small, neutral organic molecules from molecular
simulations and illustrate these approaches by applying them to calculate aqueous
solvation free energies (hydration free energies). These approaches use a
nonphysical pathway to compute free energy differences from a simulation or
set of simulations and appear to be a particularly robust and general-purpose
approach for this task. We also present an update (version 0.5) to our FreeSolv
database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies of neutral
compounds and provide input files in formats for several simulation packages. This
revision to FreeSolv provides calculated values generated with a single protocol and
software version rather than the heterogeneous protocols used in the prior version
of the database. We also further update the database to provide calculated
enthalpies and entropies of hydration and some experimental enthalpies and entropies 
as well as electrostatic and nonpolar components of solvation free energies.
