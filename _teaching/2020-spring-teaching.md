This computer-based lab course is designed for students who wish to gain hands an experience modeling biological molecules at the atomic level. In conjunction with individual interests, Molecular Mechanics, Molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, Docking (virtual screening), or Quantum Mechanics software packages can be used to study relevant biological systems (s). Projects will include setup, execution, and analysis. Course participants will give literature presentations relevant to the simulations being performed and a final project report will be required. Familiarity with Unix (Linux) is desirable but not mandatory.
