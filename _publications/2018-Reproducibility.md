Alchemical free energy calculations are an
increasingly important modern simulation technique to
calculate free energy changes on binding or solvation.
Contemporary molecular simulation software such as
AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, and SOMD include
support for the method. Implementation details vary among
those codes, but users expect reliability and reproducibility,
i.e., for a given molecular model and set of force field
parameters, comparable free energy differences should be
obtained within statistical bounds regardless of the code used.
Relative alchemical free energy (RAFE) simulation is increasingly 
used to support molecule discovery projects, yet the
reproducibility of the methodology has been less well 
tested than its absolute counterpart. Here we present RAFE calculations
of hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules 
and demonstrate that free energies can be reproduced to within
about 0.2 kcal/mol with the aforementioned codes. Absolute 
alchemical free energy simulations have been carried out as a
reference. Achieving this level of reproducibility requires 
considerable attention to detail and package-specific simulation
protocols, and no universally applicable protocol emerges. 
The benchmarks and protocols reported here should be useful for the
community to validate new and future versions of software for free energy calculations.
