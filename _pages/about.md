Overview
======
It is said that "Chemistry is the central Science" because it lies in the intersection points between multiple fields such as Physics, Biology, and Engineering, to cite a few. 
One could say that the same assessment applies to Physical Chemistry _within_ Chemistry because it provides Chemistry with the rules of the game: everything from spectra to phenomena observed in a wet lab, Physical Chemistry will, at least, give some clues on how to run our studies. I am interested in the interface between Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Pharmacology and Computation, thus my research is focused on issues pertaining these fields.
